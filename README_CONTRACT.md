# Contract scaffold â€” JIT flashloan receiver (with slippage + quoting)

The BalancerFlashJitReceiver now supports:
- Uniswap V3 swap in the flashloan callback (optional; set router first).
- Slippage guard using a Uniswap V3 Quoter (quoteExactInputSingle) to compute amountOutMinimum.
- Fallback to amountOutMinimum = 0 when the quoter is unavailable (with an event log) to keep tests/forks resilient.

Configure on-chain once after deploying your receiver:
- setSwapRouter(UNISWAP_V3_ROUTER)
- setQuoter(UNISWAP_V3_QUOTER)
- setDefaultPoolFee(3000) // or 500, 10000, etc.
- setMaxSlippageBps(200)
- setSlippageBps(50)

Notes:
- In DRY_RUN and/or without a router/quoter configured, the swap path is a no-op or uses minOut=0 fallback.
- For production, set sane slippage (e.g., 50 bps) and avoid 0 minOut unless you have other safeguards (off-chain quotes, circuit breakers).

## Helper scripts

### Generate a Flashbots auth key (unfunded)
Creates a new wallet used only to authenticate to the Flashbots relay and updates your `.env` automatically.

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/gen-flashbots-key.ts
```

Populates/updates:
- `FLASHBOTS_SIGNER_KEY=0x...`

### Deploy BalancerFlashJitReceiver
Deploys the receiver and updates your `.env` with the deployed address.

Requirements:
- `PRIMARY_RPC_HTTP` set to a mainnet RPC.
- `PRIVATE_KEY` set and funded for gas.
- `hardhat.config.ts` mainnet network present (added in this repo).

Command:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-receiver.ts --network mainnet
```

Populates/updates:
- `RECEIVER_ADDRESS=0x...`

After deployment, configure the receiver on-chain (optional but recommended):
- `setSwapRouter(UNISWAP_V3_ROUTER)`
- `setQuoter(UNISWAP_V3_QUOTER)`
- `setDefaultPoolFee(3000)`
- `setMaxSlippageBps(200)`, `setSlippageBps(50)`
