# JIT Liquidity Framework (Seed Scaffold)

This repository will host a professional-grade Uniswap v3 Just-In-Time (JIT) liquidity simulation & strategy framework.  
This **seed PR** intentionally includes only baseline tooling and configuration so that the subsequent large implementation diff is easier to review.

## What Is Included in This Seed
- `package.json` with basic scripts (`build`, `dev`, `lint`)
- TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- ESLint base setup
- `.gitignore`
- This README

No source code, tests, docs, or configs are present yet—those arrive next.

## Coming in the Next PR
The next (larger) pull request will add:
1. Math primitives (tick math approximation, liquidity math, price utilities)
2. Simulation engine (pool state model, swap execution, mint/burn abstractions)
3. Strategy layer (range selection, JIT planner, scoring)
4. Backtesting harness (runner, fixtures, performance metrics)
5. Logging & metrics modules (pino, prom-client)
6. Configuration JSON (pool metadata, strategy thresholds)
7. Documentation (Deployment, Runbook, Security)
8. Sealed specs: mempool listener + builder adapter (design only, no live connectivity)
9. Test suite (vitest) for math, invariants, and backtest summary checks

## Roadmap (High-Level)
- Phase 1: Core math & simulation scaffold
- Phase 2: Strategy heuristics & scoring refinements
- Phase 3: Enhanced volatility and inclusion probability modeling
- Phase 4: Capital allocation and multi-position optimization
- Phase 5: (Future) Optional live integration: mempool listener and builder adapter
- Phase 6: Performance tuning & risk controls

## Contributing (Early Guidance)
Feedback on:
- Project structure assumptions
- Tooling choices (TypeScript target, lint baseline)
- Planned module boundaries
…is welcome **before** the larger code lands. Formal contribution guidelines will be added later (CONTRIBUTING.md in a future PR).

## License
License to be added in a subsequent PR (likely MIT unless project direction changes).

## Disclaimer
This project is **not production-ready** in its current state.  
No on-chain connectivity, private orderflow integration, or real-time mempool processing is present yet.  
All forthcoming simulation and strategy code will be for research and testing purposes until explicitly hardened.

## Next Steps After This Seed
1. Merge this seed.
2. Open the implementation PR with the full `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, and configs.
3. Iterate on precision (replace tick math approximation with exact algorithm).
4. Introduce sealed integration modules only after internal review.

_Thank you for reviewing the seed scaffold. The lean baseline aims to keep the upcoming core diff focused and comprehensible._
